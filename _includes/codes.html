        <h4 style="font-size:140%;"> To help scheduling observations on the SPECULOOS telescopes I have developed
            this python package that aims at improving and facilitate the scheduling of observations on the
            <a href="https://www.speculoos.uliege.be/cms/c_4259452/en/speculoos">
                SPECULOOS </a>  telescopes (6 telescopes + 2 <a href="https://www.trappist.uliege.be/cms/c_5006023/fr/trappist">
                TRAPPIST</a> telescopes). <i>spock</i> computes weekly or monthly observations plans for each telescope, taking into account
            several constraints such as  the location of the observatory, the visibility of the target,
            the duration of observations, the airmass,
            the number of hours surveyed and the priority of the target (based on its stellar properties). Besides, as SPECULOOS telescopes are spread over three locations in the world spock
            plays a key role in the coordination of the observation between different observatories (SSO, SNO and SAINT-EX).<br>
